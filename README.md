# recurse_app
The program orf_finder.py will read a fasta file, generate several statistics, and output the longest orf sequences.  

INPUT: 
A multi-sequence fasta file (sample_sequences.fasta given here as example)

OUTPUTS:
Total # of sequences in fasta file, 
Sequence IDs for longest and shortest sequences, 
Lengths of longest and shortest sequences, 
Sequence ID for longest valid open reading frame (orf), 
Fasta file with protein sequence for longest valid orf for each sequence ID
